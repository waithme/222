    "# Midterm: Recommender System for Movies\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Note: This midterm assignment will have hidden test cases)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will implement a recommender system for your classmates, professor and TAs based on the movie survey we have conducted. The movie preference file is at **./data/preference.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of a Recommender System is to recommend relevant items to users, based on their preference. Recommender systems are prevalent in the digital space. For example, when you go shopping on Amazon, you notice that Amazon is recommending products on the front page before you even type anything in the search box. Similarly, when you go on YouTube, the top bar of Youtube is typically \"videos recommended to you.\" All these features are based on recommmender systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "What item to recommend to which user is arguably the most important business decision in many digital platforms. For instance, YouTube cannot control the videos its users upload to it. It cannot control which videos users like to watch either. Moreoveor, since watching videos is free, YouTube cannot control the behavior of its users by changing the price of its items. It does not have inventory either since each video can be viewed as many times as possible. In this case, what could YouTube control? Or in other words, what differentiates a good video streaming service from a bad one? The answer is its recommender system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **three** types of recommender systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Popularity-based Recommendation \n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious system is popularity-based recommendation. In this case, we recommend to a user the most popular items that the user has not previously consumed. In the movie setting, we will recommend the movie that most users have watched and liked. In other words, this system utilizes the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" It usually provides good recommendations for most people. Since it is easy to implement, the popularity-based recommendation system is used as a baseline. *Note: this system is not personalized. If two consumers have not watched Movie A, and Movie A is the most popular one, both of them will be recommended Movie A, no matter how different these two consumers are.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content-based Recommendation \n",
    "\n",
    "This recommender system leverages the data on a customer's historical actions. It first uses available data to identify a set of features that describes an item (for example, for movies, we can use the movie's director, main actor, main actress, genre, etc. to describe the movie). When a user comes in, the system will recommend the movie that is closest, in terms of these features, to the movies that the user has watched and liked. For instance, if a user likes action movies from Nolan the most, this system will recommend another action movie from Nolan that this user has not watched. *Note: we will not implement this system in this project since it requires knowledge about supervised learning. We may come back to this topic at the end of this semester.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "The last type of recommender system is called collaborative filtering. This approach uses the memory from previous users' interactions to compute users' similarities based on items they've interacted (user-based approach) or compute items' similarities based on the users that have interacted with them (item-based approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of this approach is User Neighbourhood-based CF, in which the top-N similar users (usually computed using Pearson correlation) for a user are selected first. The items that are liked by these users are then used to identify the best candidate to recommend to the current user. "
